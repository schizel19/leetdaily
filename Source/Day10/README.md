Output: [2,1]
```

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

## 2.  Remove Linked List Elements

Given the head of a linked list and an integer val, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has Node.val == val, and return the new head.

![Example 1:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/removelinked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []
```

```
Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
