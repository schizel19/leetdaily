# [Day 16 - Hash Table: Keys (pt. 3)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/184/comparison-with-other-data-structures/1121/)

## 1. Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## 2. Valid Sudoku

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Example:

```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

```
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

## 3. Find Duplicate Subtrees

Given the root of a binary tree, return all duplicate subtrees.

For each kind of duplicate subtrees, you only need to return the root node of any one of them.

Two trees are duplicate if they have the same structure with the same node values.

Example 1:
![Example:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/16/e1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,null,2,4,null,null,4]
Output: [[2,4],[4]]
```

Example 2:
![Example:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/16/e2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [2,1,1]
Output: [[1]]
```

Example 1:
![Example:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/16/e3.jpg)

```
Input: root = [2,2,2,3,null,3,null]
Output: [[2,3],[3]]
```
