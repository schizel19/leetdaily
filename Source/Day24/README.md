#  [Day 24 - Binary Tree: Challenge (pt. 3)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/133/conclusion/)

## 1. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

Given two integer arrays preorder and inorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and inorder is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

Example 1:
![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree.jpg)
```
Input: preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: preorder = [-1], inorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]
```

Constraints:
* 1 <= preorder.length <= 3000
* inorder.length == preorder.length
* -3000 <= preorder[i], inorder[i] <= 3000
* preorder and inorder consist of unique values.
* Each value of inorder also appears in preorder.
* preorder is guaranteed to be the preorder traversal of the tree.
* inorder is guaranteed to be the inorder traversal of the tree.

## 2. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Example 1:
![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/14/116_sample.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
``` 

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2^12 - 1].
* -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

Follow-up:
* You may only use constant extra space.
* The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

## 3.  Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

Given a binary tree

```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Example 1:
![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/15/117_sample.png)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
``` 

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 6000].
* -100 <= Node.val <= 100

Follow-up:
* You may only use constant extra space.
* The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

## 4. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Example 1:
![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

Example 2:
![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarytree.png)

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
* -109 <= Node.val <= 109
* All Node.val are unique.
* p != q
* p and q will exist in the tree.

## 5. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

Example 1:
![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 104].
* -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
