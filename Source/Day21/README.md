#  [Day 21 - Queue & Stack: Challenges (pt. 4)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/239/conclusion/)

## 1. Implement Queue using Stacks

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyQueue class:

* void push(int x) Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
* int pop() Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
* int peek() Returns the element at the front of the queue.
* boolean empty() Returns true if the queue is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:

* You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
* Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a stack's standard operations.
 
 Example 1:
 ```
 Input
["MyQueue", "push", "push", "peek", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, 1, false]

Explanation
MyQueue myQueue = new MyQueue();
myQueue.push(1); // queue is: [1]
myQueue.push(2); // queue is: [1, 2] (leftmost is front of the queue)
myQueue.peek(); // return 1
myQueue.pop(); // return 1, queue is [2]
myQueue.empty(); // return false
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= x <= 9
* At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, peek, and empty.
* All the calls to pop and peek are valid.

Follow-up: Can you implement the queue such that each operation is amortized O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.

## 2. Implement Stack using Queues

Implement a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal stack (push, top, pop, and empty).

Implement the MyStack class:

* void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
* int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
* int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
* boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.

Notes:

* You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means that only push to back, peek/pop from front, size and is empty operations are valid.
* Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only a queue's standard operations.

Example 1:

```
Input
["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 2, 2, false]

Explanation
MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
myStack.push(1);
myStack.push(2);
myStack.top(); // return 2
myStack.pop(); // return 2
myStack.empty(); // return False
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= x <= 9
* At most 100 calls will be made to push, pop, top, and empty.
* All the calls to pop and top are valid.
 

Follow-up: Can you implement the stack using only one queue?

## 3. Decode String

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc. Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there will not be input like 3a or 2[4].

The test cases are generated so that the length of the output will never exceed 105.

```
Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
Output: "aaabcbc"
```

```
Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
Output: "accaccacc"
```

```
Input: s = "2[abc]3[cd]ef"
Output: "abcabccdcdcdef"
```
