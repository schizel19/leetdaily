# Problems

## 1. Running Sum of 1d Array

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

> Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
> Output: [1,3,6,10]
> Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

## 2. Richest Customer Wealth

You are given an m x n integer grid accounts where accounts[i][j] is the amount of money the i​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ customer has in the j​​​​​​​​​​​th​​​​ bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

> Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
> Output: 6
> Explanation:
> 1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
> 2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
> Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
