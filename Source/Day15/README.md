#  [Day 15 - Hash Table: Hash Map (pt. 2)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/184/comparison-with-other-data-structures/1129/)


## 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.


```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

## 2. Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

## 3. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists

Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.

A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.

A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j] then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.

Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.

```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only common string is "Shogun".
```

```
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
```

```
Input: list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
Output: ["sad","happy"]
Explanation: There are three common strings:
"happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
"sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
"good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".
```

## 4. First Unique Character in a String

Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
```

```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
```

```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
```

## 5. Intersection of Two Arrays II

Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
Explanation: [9,4] is also accepted.
```

## 6. Contains Duplicate II

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
```

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
```

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
```
