#  [Day 12 - Recursion I: Recurence and Memoization (pt.1)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/)

## 1. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

Example 1:
![Example 1:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/swap_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

```
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

## 2. Reverse a Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

Example 1:
![Example 1:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

## 3. Search in a Binary Search Tree

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer val.

Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals val and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return null.

Example 1:
![Example 1:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/12/tree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]
```
