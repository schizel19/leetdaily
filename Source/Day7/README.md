#  [Day 7 - Array and String: String (pt. 2)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/array-and-string/203/introduction-to-string/)

## 1. Add Binary

Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

## 2. Implement strStr()

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
```

```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
```
