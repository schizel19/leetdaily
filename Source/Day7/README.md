#  [Day 7 - Array and String: String (pt. 2)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/array-and-string/203/introduction-to-string/)

## 1. Add Binary

Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.

```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

## 2. Implement strStr()

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

```
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
```

```
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
```

## 3. Longest Common Prefix

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

```
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

```
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

## 4. Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```
