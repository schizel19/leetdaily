#  [Day 25 - Recursion II: Divide and Conquer (pt. 1)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-ii/)


## 1. Sort an Array

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]
Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
```

## 2. Validate Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 
Example 1:
![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
![Example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

Constraints:
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
* -231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1
