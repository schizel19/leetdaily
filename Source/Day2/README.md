## 2. Find numbers with Even Number of Digits

Given an array nums of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

```
Input: nums = [12,345,2,6,7896]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
12 contains 2 digits (even number of digits). 
345 contains 3 digits (odd number of digits). 
2 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
6 contains 1 digit (odd number of digits). 
7896 contains 4 digits (even number of digits). 
Therefore only 12 and 7896 contain an even number of digits.
