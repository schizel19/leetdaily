#  [Day 8 - Array and String: Challenge (pt. 3)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/array-and-string/204/conclusion/) 


## 1. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```

```
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
```

```
Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```
