#  [Day 8 - Array and String: Challenge (pt. 3)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/array-and-string/204/conclusion/) 


## 1. Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of positive integers nums and a positive integer target, return the minimal length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If there is no such subarray, return 0 instead.

```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```

```
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
```

```
Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

## 2. Rotate Array

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```
