## 1. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.

A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Example 1:

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

## 2. Pow(x,n)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
```

```
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
```
