#  [Day 3 - Arrays 101: Deleting and Searching (pt. 2)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/fun-with-arrays/526/deleting-items-from-an-array/)

## 1. Remove Element

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
- Return k.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

```
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

## 2. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
- Return k.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

```
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

## 3. Check If N and Its Double Exist

Given an array arr of integers, check if there exist two indices i and j such that :

- i != j
- 0 <= i, j < arr.length
- arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]

```
Input: arr = [10,2,5,3]
Output: true
Explanation: For i = 0 and j = 2, arr[i] == 10 == 2 * 5 == 2 * arr[j]
```

## 4. Valid Mountain Array

Given an array of integers arr, return true if and only if it is a valid mountain array.

Recall that arr is a mountain array if and only if:

- arr.length >= 3
- There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
    - arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
    - arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]

```
Input: arr = [2,1]
Output: false

Input: arr = [3,5,5]
Output: false
```
