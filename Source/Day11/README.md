#  [Day 11 - Linked List: Challenge (pt. 3)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/linked-list/213/conclusion/1227/)


## 1. Merge Two Sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.


![Example 1:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

![Example 1:](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/addtwonumber1.jpg)

```
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

```
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

```
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```
