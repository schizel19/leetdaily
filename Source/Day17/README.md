#  [Day 17 - Hash Table: Challenge (pt. 4)](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/187/conclusion-hash-table/)

## 1. Jewels and Stones

You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

```
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

```
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

## 2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```
